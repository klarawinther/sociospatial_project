# sociospatial_project
This notebook shows the data processing and analysis for our group project (group 2) on socio-economic inequalities as related to tobacco outlet density in Edinburgh. The `edinburgh_simd' excel file is an adaptation of the original SIMD 2016 file, containing only Edinburgh data, which was used for this project.
